# Ollivier-Ricci-Flow-Experiments
Jupyter notebook for experiments which examined Ollivier Ricci flow for an Oxford research project. Written in the style of a PNAS research article. 

This project received a distinction (grade 88/100), and scored highest in the class (which was taken by over 150 Oxford mathematicians and computer scientists).

The PDF article can be found in this repository. 

## Background Information

Ollivier-Ricci curvature (the metric) and Ollivier-Ricci flow (the community detection algorithm) were invented by Ni, Lin, Luo & Gao in 2019. Their work was highly acclaimed and was published in Nature (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-46380-9). 

The method is well-explained in my article from its first principles which have origins in network geometry and optimal transport theory.
